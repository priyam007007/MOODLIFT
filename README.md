### Title : MOODLIFT
Our Moto :
> Uplifting Everyone & Spreading Happiness


Project Description:


We wanted to act as a helping hand to uplift students from their recursive thoughts that may or may not lead them to depression but hinders their quality of life and productivity in a bad way. 
We dream of uplifting every student's life with this initiative, to make them happier, to help them come out of stress, sadness, heartbreaks, and many more things. 
We had a plan to build a website supporting the project and also an application for mobile phones so that everyone is just one click away to better their lives!. 
We plan to make this project bigger by including many more things for example - a chatbot, videos to help people out!. 
We want to make MOODLIFT one of a kind to help students battle mental health with ease!!. 
At last Your Mood, Our Priority.
